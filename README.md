Michael Scott Resume
This is my first project and webpage that I am building for my online class.  I am a big fan of the office and wanted to create a simple and fun page highlighting the one and only "Michael Scott" - using my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

This was inspired by the instructor - who created a similar page about another fictitious movie character.

Enjoy!
